# ⚡ DC Microgrid Integration with Battery Storage Systems

A Smart Embedded System for Real-Time Monitoring and Source Selection

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **DC Microgrid** using an **ESP32** microcontroller to monitor real-time voltages from **solar**, **wind**, and **battery** energy sources.
Based on the sensed voltages, the system **automatically switches** between power sources using a **relay module** to ensure uninterrupted supply.

The system also features:

* **LCD Display** for live voltage monitoring
* **Blynk IoT App** for remote monitoring
* **Cloud dashboard** for alerts & history tracking
* Efficient embedded logic for intelligent source selection

## 🧠 Working Principle

1. ESP32 continuously reads analog voltages from three sensors.
2. Code compares the voltage levels with predefined cut-off thresholds:

   * Highest available voltage is prioritized
   * Solar > Wind > Battery fallback logic
3. Relay switches automatically to select the best power source.
4. LCD shows current voltages & active source.
5. Blynk displays data remotely on smartphone.
